# Timers Module

<ai>

This TypeScript `Timers` namespace provides `setTimeout` and `setInterval` functionality for Battlefield Portal experiences which run in a QuickJS runtime, which does not natively include these standard JavaScript timing functions. The module uses Battlefield Portal's `mod.Wait()` API internally to implement timer behavior, tracks active timers with unique IDs, and provides error handling to ensure robust timer execution.

**Why use Timers instead of `mod.Wait()`?** The `Timers` module offers significant advantages: timers can be cancelled with `clearTimeout()`/`clearInterval()`, multiple timers can run concurrently without blocking, automatic error handling prevents timer failures from crashing your mod, and the familiar JavaScript API makes code more readable and maintainable. Ideal for periodic tasks, delayed actions, debouncing, and any scenario where you need cancellable or recurring delays. See the [Comparing Timers to mod.Wait()](#comparing-timers-to-modwait) section below for a detailed comparison.

</ai>

Key features include automatic timer ID management, graceful error handling that prevents timer failures from crashing your mod, support for immediate interval execution, and configurable logging for debugging timer behavior. The module uses the `Logging` module for internal logging, allowing you to monitor callback errors and debug timer behavior.

---

## Quick Start

1. Install the package: `npm install -D bf6-portal-utils`
2. Import the module in your code:
    ```ts
    import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';
    ```
3. Optionally set up logging for debugging (recommended during development).
4. Use `Timers.setTimeout()` and `Timers.setInterval()` just like you would in standard JavaScript.
5. Use [`bf6-portal-bundler`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bf6-portal-bundler) to bundle your mod (it will automatically inline the code).

### Example

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

let healthCheckInterval: number | undefined;
let respawnTimeout: number | undefined;

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Optional: Configure logging for timer callback error monitoring
    Timers.setLogging((text) => console.log(text), Timers.LogLevel.Error);

    // Start a periodic health check every 5 seconds
    // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
    healthCheckInterval = Timers.setInterval(() => {
        const players = mod.GetPlayers();
        console.log(`Active players: ${players.length}`);
    }, 5_000);

    // Schedule a one-time event after 30 seconds
    // Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (return void or Promise<void>)
    Timers.setTimeout(async () => {
        console.log('Game mode has been running for 30 seconds!');
        await doSomething();
    }, 30_000);
}

export async function OnPlayerDied(
    victim: mod.Player,
    killer: mod.Player,
    deathType: mod.DeathType,
    weapon: mod.WeaponUnlock
): Promise<void> {
    // Schedule a respawn after 10 seconds
    respawnTimeout = Timers.setTimeout(() => {
        mod.SpawnPlayer(victim, mod.GetRandomSpawnPoint(mod.GetTeam(victim)));
    }, 10_000);
}

export async function OnPlayerDeployed(eventPlayer: mod.Player): Promise<void> {
    // Cancel the respawn timeout if the player already spawned.
    // You can use `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`, or `clear` - they all work the same.
    Timers.clear(respawnTimeout);
    respawnTimeout = undefined;
}

export async function OnGameModeEnded(): Promise<void> {
    // Clean up intervals when the game mode ends.
    // You can use `clearTimeout`, `clearInterval`, or `clear` - they all work the same.
    Timers.clear(healthCheckInterval);
    healthCheckInterval = undefined;

    // Optional: Check how many timers are still active (useful for debugging)
    const activeCount = Timers.getActiveTimerCount();
    if (activeCount > 0) {
        console.log(`Warning: ${activeCount} timers still active after cleanup`);
    }
}
```

### Immediate Interval Execution Example

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Start an interval that runs immediately, then every 10 seconds
    // Useful for initialization tasks that need to run right away
    Timers.setInterval(
        () => {
            // Update scoreboard, check objectives, etc.
            updateGameState();
        },
        10_000,
        true // true = immediate execution
    );
}
```

## Core Concepts

- **Timer IDs** – Each timer (timeout or interval) is assigned a unique numeric ID that can be used to cancel it later. IDs are auto-incremented starting from 1.
- **Active Timer Tracking** – The system maintains a set of active timer IDs. When a timer is cleared or completes, its ID is removed from the active set.
- **Error Handling** – Callback errors (both synchronous and asynchronous) are caught and logged (if logging is configured) but do not stop timer execution. System errors (e.g., `mod.Wait()` failures) are also handled gracefully.
- **Asynchronous Execution** – Timers run asynchronously using `async/await` with `mod.Wait()`, so they don't block your main event handlers.
- **Fire-and-Forget** – Timer callbacks are executed in fire-and-forget async functions, so you don't need to await them.
- **Configurable Error Logging** – Callback errors are automatically logged using the `Logging` module. Use `Timers.setLogging()` to configure a logger function, minimum log level, and whether to include error details. This provides visibility into timer failures without requiring manual error handling in every callback.

## Comparing Timers to mod.Wait()

While `mod.Wait()` is the underlying API used by this module, the `Timers` namespace provides significant advantages that make it a better choice for most timing scenarios:

### Key Advantages

- **Cancellable Timers** – Unlike `mod.Wait()`, which cannot be cancelled once started, timers can be cancelled at any time using `clearTimeout()` or `clearInterval()`. This is essential for scenarios like respawn timers that should be cancelled if a player spawns early, or debouncing where you need to reset a delay.

- **Concurrent Execution** – Multiple timers can run simultaneously without blocking each other or your main event handlers. With `mod.Wait()`, you'd need to carefully manage async functions and await chains, which becomes unwieldy with multiple concurrent delays.

- **Automatic Error Handling** – Timer callbacks are wrapped in error handling that prevents failures from crashing your mod. If a callback throws an error, it's caught and logged (if logging is enabled), but other timers continue running normally.

- **Familiar JavaScript API** – `setTimeout()` and `setInterval()` are standard JavaScript functions that most developers already know. This makes code more readable and maintainable compared to manually managing `mod.Wait()` calls in async functions.

- **Periodic Tasks Made Easy** – `setInterval()` provides a clean way to run recurring operations without manually implementing loops with `mod.Wait()`. The timer automatically handles the repetition and can be cancelled when no longer needed.

### Ideal Use Cases

The `Timers` module is particularly well-suited for:

- **Periodic tasks** – Scoreboard updates, health checks, periodic spawns, or any recurring operation
- **Delayed actions** – Respawn timers, delayed announcements, cleanup tasks that should happen after a delay
- **Debouncing** – Input handlers that should only trigger after a period of inactivity
- **Cancellable delays** – Any scenario where you might need to cancel a pending action (e.g., cancelling a respawn if the player manually spawns)

While `mod.Wait()` is still useful for simple, linear delays in async functions, the `Timers` module is the recommended approach for most timing needs in Battlefield Portal experiences.

## API Reference

### `namespace Timers`

The namespace is not instantiated; all members are static.

#### `Timers.LogLevel`

An enum re-exported from the `Logging` module for controlling logging verbosity. Use this with `Timers.setLogging()` to configure the minimum log level for timer callback error logging.

Available log levels:

- `Debug` (0) – Debug-level messages. Most verbose.
- `Info` (1) – Informational messages.
- `Warning` (2) – Warning messages. Default minimum log level.
- `Error` (3) – Error messages. Includes callback errors (sync and async). Least verbose.

For more details on log levels, see the [`Logging` module documentation](../logging/README.md).

#### Static Methods

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `setLogging(log?: (text: string) => Promise<void> \| void, logLevel?: LogLevel, includeError?: boolean): void` | Configures logging for the Timers module. Callback errors (both synchronous and asynchronous) are automatically caught and logged using the configured logger. This allows you to monitor and debug timer callback failures without breaking your mod. Pass `undefined` for `log` to disable logging. Default log level is `Warning`, default `includeError` is `false`. The runtime error can be very large and may cause issues with UI loggers. For more information, see the [`Logging` module documentation](../logging/README.md). |
| `setTimeout(callback: () => Promise<void> \| void, ms: number): number` | Schedules a one-time execution of `callback` after `ms` milliseconds delay. Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (returning `void` or `Promise<void>`). Returns a timer ID that can be used with `clearTimeout()`, `clearInterval()`, or `clear()`. |
| `setInterval(callback: () => Promise<void> \| void, ms: number, immediate?: boolean): number` | Schedules repeated execution of `callback` every `ms` milliseconds. Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (returning `void` or `Promise<void>`). Returns a timer ID that can be used with `clearTimeout()`, `clearInterval()`, or `clear()`. If `immediate` is `true`, the callback runs immediately before the first wait period. Defaults to `false`. |
| `clearTimeout(id: number \| undefined \| null): void` | Cancels a timeout or interval identified by `id`. Silently ignores `null`, `undefined`, or invalid IDs. This is equivalent to `clear()` and can be used interchangeably with `clearInterval()`. |
| `clearInterval(id: number \| undefined \| null): void` | Cancels an interval or timeout identified by `id`. Silently ignores `null`, `undefined`, or invalid IDs. This is equivalent to `clear()` and can be used interchangeably with `clearTimeout()`. |
| `clear(id: number \| undefined \| null): void` | Generic function to cancel a timeout or interval identified by `id`. Silently ignores `null`, `undefined`, or invalid IDs. Since timer and interval IDs are indistinguishable under the hood, this function can be used for simplicity instead of `clearTimeout()` or `clearInterval()`. |
| `getActiveTimerCount(): number` | Returns the number of currently active timers (both timeouts and intervals). Useful for performance monitoring and debugging timer leaks. |

## Usage Patterns

- **One-time delays** – Use `setTimeout()` for actions that should happen once after a delay (e.g., respawn timers, delayed announcements, cleanup tasks).
- **Periodic tasks** – Use `setInterval()` for recurring operations (e.g., health checks, scoreboard updates, periodic spawns).
- **Immediate intervals** – Use `setInterval()` with `immediate: true` when you need initialization logic that runs right away, then repeats periodically.
- **Timer cleanup** – Always clear timers when they're no longer needed (e.g., when a player leaves, when the game mode ends) to prevent memory leaks and unexpected behavior. Use `clear()`, `clearTimeout()`, or `clearInterval()`—they all work the same since timer IDs are indistinguishable.
- **Performance monitoring** – Use `getActiveTimerCount()` to monitor the number of active timers and debug potential timer leaks or performance issues.

### Example: Debounced Input Handler

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

const debounceTimers = new Map<number, number>();

export async function OnPlayerUIButtonEvent(
    player: mod.Player,
    widget: mod.UIWidget,
    event: mod.UIButtonEvent
): Promise<void> {
    const playerId = mod.GetObjId(player);

    // Clear any existing debounce timer for this player
    const existingTimer = debounceTimers.get(playerId);
    Timers.clearTimeout(existingTimer);

    // Set a new debounce timer
    const timerId = Timers.setTimeout(() => {
        // This only runs if the player doesn't click again within 0.5 seconds
        handleButtonClick(player, widget); // Some button click handler
        debounceTimers.delete(playerId);
    }, 500);

    debounceTimers.set(playerId, timerId);
}
```

### Example: Async Callback Handling

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Callbacks can now return Promise<void> directly - errors are automatically caught and logged
    Timers.setInterval(async () => {
        // Async operations here - errors are automatically caught and logged if logging is configured
        await someAsyncOperation();
        await anotherAsyncOperation();
    }, 5_000);

    // Synchronous callbacks also work
    Timers.setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('This is a synchronous callback');
    }, 1_000);
}
```

### Example: Using the Generic `clear()` Function

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

let timerId: number | undefined;

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    timerId = Timers.setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Timer fired');
    }, 5_000);
}

export async function OnGameModeEnded(): Promise<void> {
    // Use the generic clear() function for simplicity
    // Works for both timeouts and intervals
    Timers.clear(timerId);
    timerId = undefined;
}
```

### Example: Performance Monitoring

```ts
import { Timers } from 'bf6-portal-utils/timers';

export async function OnGameModeStarted(): Promise<void> {
    // Monitor active timer count for debugging
    Timers.setInterval(() => {
        const activeCount = Timers.getActiveTimerCount();
        if (activeCount > 10) {
            console.log(`Warning: ${activeCount} active timers detected`);
        }
    }, 30_000);
}
```

## How It Works

The `Timers` namespace implements timer functionality using Battlefield Portal's `mod.Wait()` API:

1. **Timer ID Generation** – Each timer receives a unique, auto-incremented ID starting from 1. This ID is added to the `_ACTIVE_IDS` set when the timer is created.

2. **setTimeout Implementation** – Creates an async function that:
    - Waits for the specified delay using `await mod.Wait(ms / 1_000)` (converts milliseconds to seconds)
    - Checks if the timer is still active (hasn't been cleared)
    - Removes the timer ID from the active set
    - Executes the callback
    - Catches and logs any errors without crashing

3. **setInterval Implementation** – Creates an async function that:
    - Optionally executes the callback immediately if `immediate` is `true`
    - Enters a `while` loop that continues while the timer ID is in the active set
    - Waits for the interval duration using `await mod.Wait(ms / 1_000)` (converts milliseconds to seconds)
    - Checks if the timer is still active before each callback execution
    - Executes the callback in a try-catch to prevent errors from stopping the loop
    - Catches system errors (e.g., `mod.Wait()` failures) and cleans up the timer

4. **Timer Cancellation** – `clearTimeout()`, `clearInterval()`, and `clear()` all remove the timer ID from the active set. Since timer and interval IDs are indistinguishable under the hood, these functions can be used interchangeably. The next time the timer checks `_ACTIVE_IDS.has(id)`, it will exit early, effectively canceling the timer.

5. **Error Isolation** – Callback errors (both synchronous and asynchronous) are caught and logged (if logging is configured via `Timers.setLogging()`) but don't prevent timers from continuing. This ensures that one failing callback doesn't break other timers or your mod's execution.

6. **Error Logging** – Callback errors are caught and logged using the `Logging` module. The logging configuration can be set via `Timers.setLogging()`, allowing you to control verbosity and error detail inclusion. This provides visibility into timer failures without manual error handling.

---

## Known Limitations & Caveats

- **Async Callbacks** – Callbacks can be synchronous or asynchronous (returning `void` or `Promise<void>`). Async callbacks are not awaited by the timer, meaning:
    - The timer doesn't wait for async operations to complete before continuing
    - Errors or rejections from async callbacks are automatically caught and logged (if logging is configured)
    - If you need to await async operations, handle that inside your callback

- **No Pause/Resume** – The current implementation does not support pausing and resuming timers. You must clear and recreate timers if you need this functionality.

- **Precision** – Timer precision depends on `mod.Wait()`'s precision, which may vary slightly based on game performance and frame timing.

- **Memory Considerations** – While timer IDs are cleaned up automatically, you should still clear timers when they're no longer needed to prevent callback references from being retained in memory.

- **Concurrent Execution** – Multiple timers can execute their callbacks concurrently. If you need sequential execution or mutual exclusion, you'll need to implement that logic yourself.

- **Timer ID Interchangeability** – Timer and interval IDs are indistinguishable under the hood. You can use `clearTimeout()`, `clearInterval()`, or the generic `clear()` function interchangeably. The generic `clear()` function is provided for simplicity.
